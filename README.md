# FarmBot Web App Demo extensions by HarvestX

## Project Background

### Introduction to FarmBot:

FarmBot is an ultimate solution for general household who wants to learn how to or has an interest in planting vegetables or crops within their own backyard. It is an interactive robotics that can help you to look after and take care of your plants. For example, it will monitor your garden based on water level, soil conditions etc… and water the plants or remove weeds automatically according to the user’s own settings. 

### The existing solution:

There are a lot of functions that are already built-in available using the FarmBot app graphically. For example,  FarmBot users are able to design their own garden’s layout. What’s more, the users are able to control their devices remotely via the web app. The app has a high degree of freedom for users to set order of executables without restrictions, more importantly, without coding manually.
