# Do I need this?

This repository is intended for *software developers* who wish to modify the [Farmbot Web App](http://my.farmbot.io/). **If you are not a developer**, you are highly encouraged to use [the publicly available web app](http://my.farmbot.io/).

If you are a developer interested in contributing or would like to provision your own server, you are in the right place.

# Farmbot Web App

**[LATEST STABLE VERSION IS HERE](https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-web-app/tree/dcf7cecf83d4b489ec55620f30614cc6b7c202f3)** :star: :star: :star:

This Repo is the Web based side of FarmBot. It allows users to control the device from their web browser. **We're getting closer to launch, but it this is an unstable pre-alpha repo.**

# Developer setup

 0. `git clone git@github.com:FarmBot/farmbot-web-app.git`
 0. `cd farmbot-web-app`
 0. [Install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
 0. Start Mongo if you have not already done so. (typically via the `mongod` command)
 0. `bundle install`
 0. `rails s`
 0. Go to `http://localhost:3000`

# Provisioning your own with Dokku

 0. Get a Dokku instance running. HINT: DigitalOcean offers one click images.
 0. Run `dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-mongo.git mongo` on the server.
 0. Push the app to the dokku server
 0. dokku mongo:create web_app_staging
 0. (on server) `dokku mongo:link web_app_staging 00-default`

# Config Settings (important)

Here are some of the configuration options you must set when provisioning a new server:

 * **Encryption keys**: Encryption keys will be autogenerated if not present. They can be reset using `rake keys:generate`. If `ENV['RSA_KEY']` is set, it will be used in place of the `*.pem` files. Useful for environments like Heroku, where file system access is not allowed.
  * `ENV['MONGO_URL']`: URL pointing to running MongoDB instance.
  * `ENV['DEVISE_SECRET']`: Used for devise. Use `rake secret` to generate a new value.
  * `ENV['MQTT_URL']`: URL of running [MQTT gateway](https://github.com/FarmBot/mqtt-gateway). This is required so that Farmbot can know where to connect when given an authorization token. 

The frontend (and asset management) are very much in a transitional state. We're experimenting with Gulp as an alternative

**We can't fix issues we don't know about.** Please submit an issue if you are having trouble installing on your local machine.
