# Roadmap

This project is still in its infancy. Our current focus as of March 2014 is to create a basic system of control for the farmbot user via technologies such as:

 * [Farmbot Controller](https://github.com/FarmBot/farmbot-controller)
 * [Skynet IoT Messaging Platform](http://www.skynet.im) ([Github](https://github.com/skynetim/skynet))
 * Ruby on Rails

Eventually, the DSS hopes to be a rich environment for users to manage their FarmBot and gain insights into the farming decision making process.
